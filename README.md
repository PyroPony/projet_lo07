# LO07 University Project

## Vaccination Site

This project has the goal to create a website using **PHP** and Database Management with **SQL**.

Iâ€™m using a **framework MVC** (Model, View, Controller) in a specific version, simplified by our teacher for easy use. 

The site **manages the vaccination process in France** (from a really simplistic approach). Indeed, I had to implement some basic functions (*approximately CRUD*) ask by the subject :
- Vaccination Area Management 
- Vaccine Management 
- Vaccine Dose Management
- Patient Management
